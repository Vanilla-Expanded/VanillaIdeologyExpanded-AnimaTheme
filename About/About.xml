	<description>A lot of players perhaps are not too keen on Gauranlen trees in Ideology DLC being yet another 'magical', unexplainable tree in the hard sci-fi world of RimWorld. I was one of them. Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Anima Theme changes Gauranlen trees to be a special kind of anima tree - and everything surrounding it has also been made in Anima style.
	
This means that not only we are expanding the Anima content, but we are also trying to hide the fact that more than one 'magical' tree is enough for the RimWorld universe. Whilst this mod changes all the Gauranlen art, it also changes the names of things to be using Anima theme. Furthermore, old Gauranlen tree - now renamed to Ancient Anima Tree, can also be used for meditation purposes same way Anima trees can!

For obvious reasons this mod requires Royalty DLC and Ideology DLC.
